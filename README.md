Python script for analysis of radio interferometry data and building transient detection pipelines

Uses variety of libraries for importing visibility data and building Python numpy arrays for manipulation. 
Supported data formats include Miriad and Measurement Sets. Uses CASA, miriad-python, and (soon) pyrap.
Focus is on building pipelines for searching for radio transients in visibilities.
